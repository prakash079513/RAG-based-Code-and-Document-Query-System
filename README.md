# RAG-based-Code-and-Document-Query-System

**Project:** RAG-based Code and Document Query System

**Description:**

Developed a full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to query entire codebases and documents, enabling context-aware and source-cited responses. The system includes a **polymorphic data pipeline** with syntax-aware code splitters and recursive chunking for robust preprocessing of both code and documents. A **semantic retrieval core** built on embeddings and ChromaDB allows fast and accurate similarity search. The project also features a **stateful Streamlit UI** integrated with a LangChain (LCEL) chain for interactive querying.

**Key Features:**

- Full-stack Python RAG application using the Gemini API for querying codebases and documents
- Polymorphic data pipeline with syntax-aware code splitters and recursive chunking
- Semantic retrieval core with embeddings and ChromaDB for similarity search
- Interactive Streamlit UI integrated with LangChain (LCEL) for context-aware, source-cited responses

**Tech Stack:**

Python, Gemini API, ChromaDB, LangChain, Streamlit, FAISS
